# ironhack final project
## Analysis of worldy energy consumption and time-series energy forecast

### Goal of the project
Understand development of renewable energies and nuclear during the year 
1900 - 2020 for each part of the world. Highlight anomalies, interesting facts, 
personal opinions etc.

Then, when some sort of focus is chosen (forecast of renewables, forecast  of
nuclaer, energy scenarios?) and a ML model will be applied in order to forecast
energy consumption in some sort of time-span and country/area selection.

Probably, the ML model will need more hourly energy-consumption related data,
I will need detailed data consumption data from certain countries and, at least,
hourly consumption from different sources of energy.

*bonus*.
Try to predict prices??
